# ML Fusion Labs - Learn Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to **ML Fusion Labs**! This project aims to provide an interactive platform where users can learn machine learning from scratch, explore projects, and contribute their own machine learning endeavors.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive machine learning courses**: From beginner to advanced levels.
- **Hands-on projects**: Real-world projects to apply and improve your ML skills.
- **Community contributions**: A platform where users can upload and contribute to machine learning projects.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The homepage of the website.
- `courses.html`: The dedicated page for listing available machine learning courses.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for designing the website.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling interactivity.
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your username/ML-Fusion-Lab-Website.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ml-fusion-labs
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to the project by:

- Adding more tutorials, projects, or new sections to the website.
- Improving the design or interactivity.
- Fixing any bugs or issues.

### Guidelines for Contributors

1. **Code Quality**: Ensure that all code is clean, readable, and follows the best coding practices.
2. **Feature Branches**: Create separate branches for each new feature (e.g., `feature/add-search`).
3. **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `Added search functionality for courses`).
4. **Testing**: Test new features before submitting them.
5. **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests to the `main` branch for review.

## Future Plans

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and upload their own projects.
- **Machine Learning Playground**: An interactive section where users can try out ML models directly on the site.
